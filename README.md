<h3>Gameplay and controls</h3>
<h4>Spawning objects</h4>
<p>The game features a spawn menu on the left side of the screen. You can choose from a wide variety of items, characters, weapons, and props. Simply click and drag your desired item from the menu into the game world.</p>
<h4>Interacting with objects</h4>
<p>Use the left mouse button to drag and drop objects. This is how you place items and manipulate their position in the scene.</p>
<h4>Accessing options</h4>
<p>The right mouse button is your key to more advanced options. Right-clicking an object will bring up a menu that allows you to delete it, freeze its position, and more.</p>
<h4>Experimenting with physics</h4>
<p>The core of Melon Sandbox is experimentation. You can attach weapons to characters, create explosions, or crash vehicles to see how they interact with each other and the environment.</p>
<h4>Starting over</h4>
<p>&nbsp;If your scene gets too chaotic or you want to start fresh, you can click the "Clear Everything" button to reset the entire world and begin anew.</p>
